"Bait": Creating something others desire, it's information, resources, or social status.
By offering something that satisfies people's needs or desires, you can manipulate them into coming to you.
Making your time or resources seem scarce can increase their perceived value, further enticing others to seek you.

Understanding the motivations of others is crucial.

- Establish yourself as an indispensable resource or source of knowledge, skill, or support. This involves identifying what others lack and positioning yourself as the solution.
- By witholding key information or skills, you ensure that others remain reliant on you.

- Gather intelligence without arousing suspicion. This involves being observant, asking indirect questions, and actively listening to what others say. Be aware of social dynamics, identifying key players, and understanding their motivations.
- Once you've gathered information, it's crucial to handle it discreetly and avoid revealing your sources. This maintains credibility and prevents others from becoming defensive. 

- The world is in a constant state of change. By isolating yourself, you can become out of touch with those changes, making you vulnerable to those who are more aware.

- Some people are easily offended, while others are more tolerant.
- Before engaging with someone, it's wise to gather information about their background, reputation, and temperament.
- Sometimes, people with significant power may appear unassuming. It's crucial to avoid underestimating anyone, as this can lead to disastrous consequences.

- It's crucial to identify the most critical objectives and prioritize your efforts accordingly. Avoid wasting time and energy on trivial matters.
- Distractions can divert your attention and weaken your focus. It is essential to remain disciplined and avoid being sidetracked.

- A perfect courtier is skilled at subtle flattery, indirect influence, and reading between the lines.

- People are drawn to those who offer them a sense of hope, excitement, or fulfillment. It's about crafting a narrative or image that appeals to people's desires and aspirations.
- Understand people's deepest desires -- whether it's wealth, power, love, or fame -- is crucial. By offering them the illusion of achieving these desires, you can gain their loyalty and support.
